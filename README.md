# Horizontal Bars

![Horizontal Bars](horizontalBars.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

- Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
- Open the project folder in a terminal:

        npm install              # fetches dependencies
        npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

- The application is available at *http://localhost:8080* in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

*Also known as Bar Graph, Column Chart or Column Graph*

Similarly to ***Column Chart or Vertical Bar Chart***, this example shows the creation of a column chart made on user side by utilizing RectangleSeries, but displays data as horizontal bars. Bar Charts show discrete numerical comparisons across categories, where the value represents the length of a bar.

The following code below shows the creation of a Horizontal Bar Chart using a pre-defined interface. Moreover, the current interface allows visualizing columns with negative values.

The bar series accepts points in format `{ category: string, value: number }`. Any number of points can be added with a single call.

```javascript
// Create Chart.
const chart = barChart()

// Add bars.
chart.addValues([
    { category: 'A', value: 20 },
    { category: 'B', value: -30 }
])
```

The actual Bar Chart logic just serves to provide a starting point for users to create their own API based on their needs and preferences.
